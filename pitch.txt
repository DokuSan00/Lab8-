Game Idea:
We're making an RPG game. It takes place in a world full of zombies and the player must break through every mission, meet every conditions to end the game. During the game, the player will engage with zombies (enemies), and must interact with npc to complete the missions. In addition, we will add some dialogs to appear during the game.

Character Desciption:
For this game, we will use top down perspective and we also plan to make the game half pixel-like.

1. The MC will be the Survivor (John): Wears dark green clothes and armed with 3 weapons.

2. There's also a girl (NPC): she will always follows the MC after the player finds her. She is an important condition to finish the game.

Character's goals: Follow the given mission, and gradually progress through the game story.


Win condition: Get to the end of the story and wait for rescuer.
Lost Condition: When health reaches zero during the process.

Progression of Levels: There will be a story line or a question where the player must finish each mision to progress and eventually reach end game. Though, the game won't have any power up for either the player and the zombies.

Inspiration:
Unescapable is inspired by games like Left For Dead for a zombie-esque world, and games like Zenonia for its RPG element,...

What skills/interests:
we only need a member that has basic programming skills or basic art skills.
